The MyUSB library uses VID/PID combinations generously donated by Atmel. The following VID/PID combinations are used within the MyUSB demos, and thus may be re-used by derivations of each demo. Free PID values may be used by future MyUSB demo projects.

These VID/PID values should not be used in commercial designs under any circumstances. Private projects may use the following values freely, but must accept any collisions due to other MyUSB derived private projects sharing identical values. It is suggested that private projects using interfaces compatible with existing demos share the save VID/PID value.
