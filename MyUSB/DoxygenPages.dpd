 *  \mainpage MyUSB Library
 *
 *  Written by Dean Camera, 2008.
 *
 *  \section Sec_About About this library
 *
 *  Originally based on the AT90USBKEY from Atmel, it is an open-source, driver for the USB-enabled AVR
 *  microcontrollers, released under the Lesser GNU Public Licence, Version 3. Currently, the AT90USB1286,
 *  AT90USB1287, AT90USB646, AT90USB647, AT90USB162, AT90USB82 and ATMEGA32U4 AVR microcontrollers are supported
 *  by the library. Supported boards are the USBKEY, STK525, STK526 and RZUSBSTICK.
 *
 *  The library is currently in a stable release, suitable for download and incorporation into user projects for
 *  both host and device modes. For information about the project progression, check out my blog.
 *
 *  MyUSB is written specifically for the free AVR-GCC compiler, and uses several GCC-only extensions to make the
 *  library API more streamlined and robust. You can download AVR-GCC for free in a convenient windows package, 
 *  from the the WinAVR website.

 *  \section Sec_License License
 *  The MyUSB library is currently released under the LGPL licence, version 3. Please see the license file
 *  included with the library before use.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Demos Demos and Bootloaders
 *  The MyUSB library ships with several different host and device demos, located in the /Demos/ subdirectory.
 *  If this directory is missing, please re-download the project from the project homepage.
 *
 *  Also included with the library are two fully functional bootloaders, one using the DFU USB class and is
 *  compatible with Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer project, and the other using the
 *  CDC class and the AVR109 protocol to be compatible with such open source software as avrdude and AVR-OSP.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Donations Donate
 *  I am a 19 year old University student studying for a double degree in Computer Science and Electronics
 *  Engineering. This leaves little time for any sort of work or leisure. Please consider donating a small amount
 *  to myself to support this and my future Open Source projects. You can donate any amount via PayPal on my
 *  website, http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com . All donations are greatly appreciated.

 /** \page Page_VIDPID VID and PID values
  *
  *  The MyUSB library uses VID/PID combinations generously donated by Atmel. The following VID/PID combinations
  *  are used within the MyUSB demos, and thus may be re-used by derivations of each demo. Free PID values may be
  *  used by future MyUSB demo projects.
  *
  *  These VID/PID values should not be used in commercial designs under any circumstances. Private projects may
  *  use the following values freely, but must accept any collisions due to other MyUSB derived private projects
  *  sharing identical values. It is suggested that private projects using interfaces compatible with existing
  *  demos share the save VID/PID value.
